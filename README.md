# Insurance Dataset Analysis Project
### Objectives
The main objective of this project is to analyze the given dataset to understand patterns and trends in the data, to draw conclusions relating to how factors like region, age, gender and pre-existing conditions affect a customer's insurance charges and to develop a model that can predict the charges for a given individual based on their age, sex, region, smoker status, and number of children.

### About the data
The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:

- age: age of the individual
- sex: male or female
- region: the region where the individual resides
- charges: the cost of insurance for the individual
- smoker: whether the individual is a smoker (yes or no)
- number of children: number of children the individual has
The dataset is reasonably large and contains a good mix of demographic data and insurance charges.
